✅ MOST Important Topics (Must-Practice)

These are asked in almost every fresher DS/DA interview:

1. Basic Data Types

Integers, floats, booleans

Type conversion

Rounding, modulo, floor/ceil

2. Strings

Counting characters

Splitting/joining

Substring search

Reversing

Removing duplicates

Palindrome check

3. Lists & Dictionaries (Built-ins)

Insert, delete, sort

List comprehension

Dictionary lookup, counting frequency

Convert lists <-> dict

4. Sets

Removing duplicates

Set operations: union, intersection

5. Math

Absolute values

Power, square root

Min/max

Simple calculations

6. Collections (MOST useful)

Counter → frequency counts

defaultdict → grouping

OrderedDict

deque for queue problems

7. Itertools

product, permutations, combinations

Most common for combinatorics questions

8. Errors and Exceptions

Basic try/except handling

9. Regex (Sometimes asked)

Extract numbers, emails

Split using patterns

10. Numpy (Data Science MUST)

Create arrays

Indexing

reshape

mean, sum, axis operations

concatenate

boolean filtering

🟡 Medium Importance (Practice if time allows)
11. Date and Time

Only basics:

Parse string to date

Format date

Difference between two dates

12. Python Functionals

map, filter, lambda

Very commonly asked in data roles

13. Built-ins

sorted, zip, enumerate, any, all

Extremely useful in solving DS problems

🔵 Lower Importance (Rarely asked for DS fresher)

Practice only if extra time:

14. Closures and Decorators

Not required for fresher DS interviews

Only know what a decorator does

15. XML

Very rare

You may skip

16. Debugging

Mostly simple syntax/logical fixes

Not heavy

17. Classes (OOP)

Understand basics:

class

init

creating objects

But deep OOP is usually NOT asked in DS/DA fresher interviews

⭐ FINAL PRIORITY LIST (In Order)

If you have 30 minutes per day, practice in THIS ORDER:

Strings

Lists + Dictionaries

Collections (Counter, defaultdict)

Math problems

Sets

Itertools

Built-in functions (sorted, zip, enumerate)

map / filter / lambda

Numpy

Regex

You can safely skip:

XML

Deep OOP

Deep decorators

Complex datetime problems
